<b>Why is it recommended to use extensions? </b>
Extensions are similar to Tampermonkey scripts, but they provide a better experience and can achieve some planned features that Tampermonkey scripts have many limitations with.

<h3>💥 Feature Introduction:</h3>
1、Optimized Video Detail Page Interface: You can now browse comments while watching the video. This feature moves the video description, comments, and recommended videos to the right side of the YouTube playback page without affecting functionality.
2、Beautified Video Playback Progress Bar: The progress bar has been enhanced to make the page more vibrant.
3、Page Ad Marking to Prevent Accidental Clicks: Ads are one of YouTube's revenue sources, and I don't intend to remove them.
4、Video Fast Forward (with adjustable playback speed).
5、One-click Screenshot for Videos.
6、Dark/Light Theme Switch (using YouTube's official method to make the page more visually appealing).
7、Picture to picture and New Tab Playback
8、Youtube video download. <b>(PS:Downloading YouTube videos will call third-party websites. The behavior of third-party websites cannot be controlled by the script.Please use with caution!)</b>

<b>Tips:</b>
The ad-blocking feature is a complex and highly intrusive function that can easily lead to issues if not implemented properly. Therefore, this feature needs to be restructured (temporarily removed in the latest version). There are some excellent ad-blocking extensions available for Chrome and Edge that work exceptionally well. They also support YouTube ad-blocking and perform impressively.
